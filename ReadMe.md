# GWMSIST: RDBS | Lab2: MariaDB * AWS

Objective: In this lab we will work through many of the SQL commands discussed in lecture.  As a guide to using these commands we will use our textbook on MariaDB (mostly the same as MySQL).  You will be using the Amazon RDS instance created in Lab 1

## Deliverable

TODO: History log from your mysql command line session.

## Usage

TODO:  For this lab, work through these sections in the *MariaDB Crashcourse* textbook.  Note: in some of the later labs you may get an error that a table already exists.  The reason is the batch files we ran in Lab 1.  Ignore the error and keep moving forward.

## History

TODO: Report terminal-output according to following command below:

`./mysql -h istm6202-lab01-a.cg8qnwa72czw.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -u alex -p --tee=alexsing@gwu.edu_mysqlout_1.txt`

Please mind the `.` appended to the above command if within the working-directory- if not, please disregard and remove `.`

`/mysql -h istm6202-lab01-a.cg8qnwa72czw.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -u alex -p --tee=alexsing@gwu.edu_mysqlout_1.txt`

## References

1. According to [MariaDB documentation](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/aria-faq/), the MySQL-version (not exatly MariaDB with this lab) featured on the AWS ec2 instance is deprecated- so use `ENGINE=InnoDB` in lieu of `ENGINE=Aria`;
